# Extra Credit

A developer option I noticed is a feature called "Enable GPU debug layers", which from research online is something that allows Vulkan validation layers onto an Android device like the phone I am using. It is used by game developers who want to use it for 3D rendering in their games, to fix bugs and error checking without having to be in developer mode on the device. But primarily used for Vulkan-based apps and games when developers want to test their products. I don't think I will be using this feature in class this quarter since I don't think I will be making a game that needs 3D rendering or models.
